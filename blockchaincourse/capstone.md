# Capstone Project: Blockchain Implementation
## Problem Identification and Justification for Using Blockchain
### Problem Identification
Describe the real-world problem that you have identified and
justify why it is a significathat issue that needs addressing.
### Justification for Using Blockchain
Explain why blockchain technology is the best solution for this problem. 
Discuss the benefits that blockchain can bring to solving this problem, such as increased transparency, security, and efficiency.
## Design of the Blockchain Architecture
### Blockchain Type
Specify the type of blockchain you will use (public, private, orconsortium)and justify your choice.
### Network Nodes
Describe the network nodes that will be part of your blockchain architecture. 
Explain the role of each node and how they will interact with each other.
### Data Structure
Explain the data structure that will be used in your blockchain.
Describe how data will be stored and accessed within the blockchain.
## Consensus Mechanism Selection and Justification
### Consensus Mechanisms
Discuss the different consensus mechanisms available (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, etc.).
### Selected Consensus Mechanism
Identify the consensus mechanism you have selected for your blockchain solution and justify your choice. Discuss how
this consensus mechanism will ensure the security and integrity of the blockchain.
## Implementation Strategy
### Development Plan
Outline your development plan for implementing the blockchain solution. Include key milestones, timelines, and resources required.
### Testing and Deployment
Describe your strategy for testing the blockchain solution to ensure it meets the requirements. Explain how you will deploy the solution and monitor its performance.
## Potential Challenges and Solutions
### Challenges
Identify potential challenges you may face during implementation of the blockchain solution.
### Solutions
Propose solutions to address these challenges. Discuss how you will mitigate risks and ensure the successful implementation of the blockchain solution.
