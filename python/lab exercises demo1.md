# Week 1
1. What are common uses for python?
2. What are some key characterstics of python?
3. What are the pros and cons of high-level languages such as python?
4. What are the pros and cons of dynamic typing?

# Week 2
//Debugging expressions
1. where is the error in the expressions, how would you fix the expression

1. 1.  var name = null
1. 2. Username= 24;
1. 3. string name = 12
1. 4. void = 24
1. 5. if = 27

2. What is wrong with the following code block?
2. 1.
animal = "cat", num = 28
outcome= num +animal

2. 2. 
animal= "dog", animal2="cat"
animal3= animal + animal2

2.3
newVar=1+5
newVar= "1+5"

2.4.
num1=1, num2="2"
num3=num1+num2
print(num3)

Jacob has problems with the variable userAge causing errors, he has a hunch that it may be due to the typing of the variable. How can this be optimized
userAge=input



# Week 3
1. Create a program that checks whether or not a number is positive
//Incorrect comparison operators
//Inconsistent indentation

Using the len() operator check whether or not a given string is more than 5 characters long

2. Create a program that checks whether or not someone is rich, poor or upper class by their income, curate the ranges 

3. Create a program to choose an order from a set of numbers 1-10, you get to choose what the items are, but once selected they should display  the name of the selected dish. You should also display an error message if the chosen number is out of the selected range.

4. 1.Optimize this bit of code
If NumLength.type = 5:
	print(" Your string is 5 charcters long)

4. 2.Optimize this block of code
if num=1:
	print("number is 1")
else if num = 2:
	 print("number 2")
else if num = 3:
	 print("number 3")
else if num = 4:
	 print("number 4")
else if num = 5:
	 print("number 5")

5.  What is wrong with the following blocks of code
5. 1.
if age>18:
print("You are an adult")
5. 2.
if studentID = valid:
	 print("Valid")
5. 3.
if variable.type === string
	print("This var is string type")
# Week 4
//create a void function
//a string function
//a numerical function
//a single input and multi input function

1. Create a function that calculates the remainder of  two numbers that have been divided
2. Create a function that calculates the sum of the first n numbers.
3. Create a function that allows the user to input their name and output a welcome message. The output must be a string

4. what is wrong with the given function
4. 1.
func numberCount:
	if input>0:
		print("positive")
4. 2.
def  sum(num1, num2)=>int:
	sum=num1+num2
	 output(sum)
	 return sum
	 \
4. 3.
def multiply(num1, num2):
	 product == num1* num2
return product
# Week 5
1. Loop through the given array :
	myArr=[2,6,3,23,17, 3]
	1. 1.Find the largest value, median value and smallest value
	1. 2. Loop through the array and stop when the element of the array is greater than 5

//Stop if a certain value is met before the array is finished



//using the while loop
//conditional function execution
2. Say that you have the array:

	multOf2=[2, 4, 6, 8, 13, 12]
	
	1. Loop through the array and output each element divided by 2. If there is a value that is not divisible by 2, stop the execution of the loop.
	
	2.  Instead of cancelling execution, skip the value not divisible by 2
	
	3. Print all values less than 10

//using nested loops
3. Given the multivariable array:

	myArr=[[1,2,3,4,5] , [2,4,6,8,10], [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]]
	
	 1. Use a loop to find all the values that exist in more than one array
	 
	2. Print the third to fifth element of each array

error checking in loops and more complex loops
4. Error checking
4. 1.
for a in a:
	print(a, "is a number")

4. 2.
for a in range(3, 3, 3, 4)
	print a


# Week 6

# Week 7
//Understands indexing
//understands identities in dictionaries
//creating and concatenating lists

1. You are given the lists of grades in a class, we want you to take the top 3 achievers of each class and add them to a list

1. 1. We want you to return the position of the middle achiever of each class

1. 2. Return the names of each of the achievers congratulating them in your program


2. Create a program that allows a user to input their name, surname and a favorite fact about themselves , store these inputs in your program and output them for the user to see that they've entered it. There must also be checking to ensure that the length of a given  name doesn't exceed a character count of 20.
