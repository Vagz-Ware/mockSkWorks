## Course Highlights

### Application Security for Essential Programming Languages
This course focuses on application security for essential programming languages, helping you identify and address security issues in vital languages including:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- ReactJS
- NodeJS
- PHP
- C#
- ASP .NET
- Java
- Swift/C++

### Advanced Vulnerability Detection
Learn advanced vulnerability detection techniques, including injection flaws, and how to secure your code against them.

### Comprehensive Code Security Analysis
Discover how to perform in-depth code security analysis to detect a wide range of security issues. This includes vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), buffer overflows, authentication issues, cloud secrets detection, and more.

### Security Rules
Our security rules are classified according to well-established security standards such as PCI DSS, CWE Top 25, and OWASP Top 10.

### Third-Party Libraries
Identify and resolve application code issues originating from interactions with third-party open-source libraries.

### Data Flow Analysis
Learn how to trace data flow in and out of libraries, effectively uncovering deeply concealed security vulnerabilities that other tools may fail to detect.

### Taint Analysis
Understand the importance of user-provided data sanitization to ensure application code security. Taint analysis tracks untrusted user input throughout the execution flow, providing security against various threats.
